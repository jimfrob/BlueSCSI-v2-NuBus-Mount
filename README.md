# BlueSCSI-v2-NuBus-Mount

Being unable to find a design that allowed for mounting a BlueSCSI directly in a NuBus slot (existing models were only for an SD card extension), I decided to take two relevant models and modify them to do so.

The bracket I modified can be found at https://www.printables.com/model/849210-bluescsi-v2-50-pin-desktop-universal-mount

The NuBus shield I modified can be found at https://github.com/alxlab-zone66x/Reference_Design_Library/tree/main/Connector%20Shield%20for%20Macintosh%20II-Family%20Computer

I did my best to align everything by using an STL generated from the KiCad PCB editor for the BlueSCSI v2 GitHub project (https://github.com/BlueSCSI/BlueSCSI-v2)

I will include my Bambu Studio project file as well as the extension I made in FreeCAD for the bracket.
